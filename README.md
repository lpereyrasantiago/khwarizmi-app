# khwarizmi-app

Khwarizmi App is a web application that provides a live and simple algebra framework to solve algebraic operations online 
and instantaneously. Application is built using Flask, while the operations are solved by communicating the server with [khwarizmi](https://github.com/lpereyrasantiago/khwarizmi),
a Python algebra library that facilitates algebraic operations on Python. The operation is solved by the library and then 
the solution is sent to and displayed by the app.
